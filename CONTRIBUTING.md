# Contributing to Open Inventions

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This repository exists to keep inventions free and open — contributions that strengthen that mission are welcome.

## What You Can Contribute

- **New disclosures** for inventions you want to protect from corporate capture
- **Improvements** to existing disclosures (additional detail, better drawings, alternative embodiments)
- **Test results** from building or testing a disclosed invention
- **Software implementations** for inventions that include code
- **Translations** to make disclosures accessible in other languages

## Contribution Rules

1. **Everything must be your original work** or properly attributed open-source content. Do not submit anything covered by someone else's patent, copyright, or trade secret.

2. **All contributions inherit the repository's licenses:**
   - Documentation: CC BY-SA 4.0
   - Hardware designs: CERN-OHL-S-2.0
   - Software: GPL-3.0
   
   By submitting a contribution, you agree to license your work under these terms.

3. **Do not submit anything you want to keep proprietary.** Once published here, it becomes prior art and open-source. This cannot be undone.

4. **Follow the template.** Use the disclosure and metadata templates in `/templates/` for consistency.

5. **Be thorough.** The strength of a defensive disclosure depends on the level of detail. A vague description is easy to patent around. A thorough one is not.

## How to Submit

2. Create a new branch for your contribution
3. Follow the structure in the templates
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description of what you're adding
