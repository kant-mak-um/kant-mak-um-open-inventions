## 1. Abstract

A strap fastening device that combines the tightening function of a cam buckle with an integrated quick-release mechanism, enabling rapid connection, disconnection, and tensioning in a single unit. Unlike existing cam buckles which require threading a strap end through the buckle for each use, this device allows the strap to be quickly snapped into and released from the cam mechanism while retaining full tightening capability under load. This eliminates the need for separate quick-release buckles and cam tighteners, reducing part count, weight, and complexity in applications ranging from cargo securing to outdoor equipment.

## 3. Background and Problem Statement

### 3.1 Existing Solutions

Cam strap tighteners (cam buckles) are widely used in cargo securing, outdoor recreation, and industrial applications. They work by threading a strap through a buckle housing containing a spring-loaded cam that grips the strap when tension is applied. To release, the cam is lifted and the strap pulled free.

Separately, quick-release buckles (side-release buckles, snap buckles) allow rapid connection and disconnection of straps but offer no tightening adjustment — excess strap length must be managed with a separate tri-glide or similar adjuster.

### 3.2 Problem to Be Solved

No existing single device provides both quick-connect/disconnect functionality and cam-based strap tightening. Users currently must choose between convenience (quick-release) and secure tensioning (cam buckle), or use multiple components together, adding weight, cost, bulk, and failure points.
