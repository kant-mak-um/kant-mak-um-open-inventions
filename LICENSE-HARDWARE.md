# CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 — Strongly Reciprocal (CERN-OHL-S-2.0)

This license applies to all hardware designs in this repository.

Full license text: https://ohwr.org/cern_ohl_s_v2.txt

## Summary

This is the hardware equivalent of the GPL. It ensures that:

- Anyone can **use, study, modify, and distribute** the hardware designs
- Anyone who distributes modified designs **must also make their modifications available** under the same license
- The designs **cannot be made proprietary** — all derivatives must remain open

This is the strongest protection against corporate capture of hardware designs.
